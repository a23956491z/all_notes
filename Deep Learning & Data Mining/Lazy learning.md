## Lazy v.s. Eager leanring
* **Lazy** learning :
	* stores simple traning data, wait for sepicific test tuple
	* Less traning time, more predict time
	* multiple hypothesis from linear functions
* **Eager** leanring :
	* given traning set, build a model to classify new data
	* single hypothesis


## Instance-Based
Store training data and compare the new instance(data)
Methods:
* [[KNN | K-Nearest Neighbor approach]]
* locally weighted regression
* case-based reasoning

## Case-Based reasoning
Need domain knowledge, Store symbolic description.
> Uses a database of problem solutions to solve new problems
