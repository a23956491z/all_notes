**Any periodic function** can be expressed as the su m of sines and/or cosines of different frequency, each multiplied by a different coefficient

**Functions that are not periodic** & area under curve is finete, can be expressed as the intergral of sines and/or cosines multiplied by a weighting function.

a function, expressed in either a Fourier series or transform, can be reconstructed completely via an inverse process with no loss of information.
*This is why we can use Fourier transform to deal with praical problem*
