purpose of image processing:
* improve pictorial information for human
* redner it for autonomous machine

1. Sharpen : enhacing the edges

2. Remove noise

 3. Remove motion blur

4. edge enhancement

5. Blurring to remove detail

## Image Sampling & Acquisition
### Sample
**Nyquist criterion**
* require sampleing frequency be at least **twice the  highest frequency** in signal
* so we can construct a near continuous function

correct sampleing vs undersampled:
* we get a **aliasing** in undersampled picture
	* e.g.  [moir√© pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moir%C3%A9_pattern)
	* aliasing is an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable when sampled.

### Image Acquisition
using CCD(Charge Coupled Device) camera

### Images vs Digital Images
* digital image : a array of sampled point from real image
	* these point are **pixels**
	* neighborhood : some pixels around the pixel
	* ![](https://i.imgur.com/Ct3cyJx.png)

each pixel have a color value from 0 ~ 255
* for example, gray scale:

applications:
* Medicine
* Ariculture
* Indusrty
* Law enforcement

Image Analysis
* Feature Extraction
* Pattern Classification

### Applications
* Image Resotration
	* Remove motion blue 
	* Remove *distortions*
	* Remove *periodic interference*
* Image Enhancement
	* Sharpen or deblur
	* Highlight edges
	* Improve image constrast
	* Remove noise
* Image Segmentation
	* finding the shape of objects in an image
* Image Compression
