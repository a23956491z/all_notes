The answer to that question lies in websites such as:

-   [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com)
-   [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)
-   [CVE Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org)

IF you have **CVE**(Common Vulnerablilities and Exposures) it would be better to search on **NVD**

CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER
