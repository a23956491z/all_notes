## Severity 1 : Injection

Common example:
* SQL injection
* Command injection

Able to :
* Access, Modify, Delete information in database
* gain access to usersâ€™ systems

### OS command injection

 server-side code (e.g. PHP) make a **system call** in hosting machine
 
 worst thing : Spawn a reversahell 
 * e.g. `;nc -e /bin/bash`

*blind command injection* : Server does not return the response
*Active command injection* : Return the response to the user

code exmaple

1.  Checking `commandString` is set or not
2.  If it set, `$command_string` get the value of input field
3.  Execute the function `passthru($command_string)`
4.  If comes with error, output the error to page

How to detect Active command Injection:
* If someone write code like this, we can try some shell commands to detect
* Linux : `whoami` `id` `ifconfig/ip addr` `uname -a`
* Windows : `whoami` `ver` `ipconfig` `tasklist` `netstat -an`

## Severity 2 : Broken Authentication

common flaws :
* Brute force attacks
* Weak crednetial : strong password policy (easy password are not allowed)
* Weak Session Cookie : session value should not contain predictable values

Solve the flaws:
* Enforce a strong password policy
* Automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts
* Multi Factor Authentication : e.g. using code on their mobile device

### Re-registration of an existing user

register account in user : ` admin`
and it register new user but this user have same right as normal admin.

## Severity 3 : Sensitive Data Exposure

data directly linked to customers (names, financial infor...)

*flat-file* databses : databases stored as files
common one is `sqlite3`

### intro to sqlite3

access SQlite databae: `sqlite3 <database-name>`
