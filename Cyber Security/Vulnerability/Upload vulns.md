be the way to **Remote Code Execution(RCE)**

vulns:
* Overwriting existing files
* Upadloing & executing shells
* Bypassing Client-Side filtering
* Bypassing Server-Side filtering
* Fooling content type validation checks

## Methodology
**enumeration is key**

looking source code to find client-side filtering vuln
scanning with a directory bruteforcer : `sudo apt install gobuster`


## Overwriting Existing Files
when files are uploaded to server, server should ensure the file will not overwrite anything which alreading exists on server.

Common practice:
* Assign file with a new name or random name

### if we don't have overwriting check
we found the website display the image with `images/spaniel.jpg`

if we have website like this, we can upload our `spaniel.jpg` to overwriting existing file as attack
